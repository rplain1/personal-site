## Bio

Iâ€™m a data analyst living in Colorado Springs, currently working in product analytics for small business solutions. Previously, I worked simulating passenger and and bag traffic through airport facilities.

My passion is in making processes more efficient. Whether that is ETL pipelines to expose better analytics tables, visualizations that save time on investigating or filtering, or automating tedious steps in the analysis workflow. I'm a proponent of working with what tool and environment works best for you, and enjoy designing solutions to be inclusive for everyone. 

In my free time I love exploring the outdoors, climbing, yoga, and spending time with my wife, dogs, and evil cat.
